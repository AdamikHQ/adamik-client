## Getting Started

The Adamik-Client application is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your development machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) or [bun](https://bun.sh/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/adamik-client.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    cd adamik-client
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    # or
    bun install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
